Traffic law in the Philippines consists of multiple laws that govern the regulation and management of road transportation and the conduct of road users within the country.

The official and latest traffic code of the Philippines is Republic Act No. 4136, also known as the "Land Transportation and Traffic Code", which was enacted into law on June 20, 1964.[1]

Since its enactment in 1964, there have been 12 amendments to RA 4136, the latest being in 2017.

Vehicles
Motor vehicles are defined by RA 4136 and the Metro Manila Traffic Code as any vehicle propelled by any power other than human power. Exceptions to this definition include vehicles on railway tracks, motor vehicles such as road rollers, trolley cars, street sweepers, sprinklers, lawn mowers, bulldozers, graders, forklifts, amphibian trucks, and cranes when not on public roads, as well as tractors, trailers, and vehicles with traction engines used exclusively for agriculture. In addition, trailers with any number of wheels propelled or intended to be proplled by a motor vehicle are classified as a separate motor vehicle.[1][22]

Regulations for the use of bicycles and other non-motorized vehicles are defined by the DOTr in Department Order No. 2020-14.[18]

Motor vehicle classifications
Motor vehicles in the Philippines are classified by the Land Transportation Office (LTO) according to vehicle category classifications established by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).[35] Vehicles are classified according to whether they are propelled by diesel, electric, or gasoline powered motor engines, as well as maximum design speed and vehicle weight. Electric motor vehicles are classified in a similar manner, but are subject to additional criteria based on power output, particularly for light electric vehicles (LEVs), which have added restrictions and exemptions.[20]

Electric vehicles were first classified on May 11, 2021 with the issuance of LTO Administrative Order No. 2021-039. This order integrated purely electric-powered vehicles into the existing vehicle category classification system and introduced specific requirements for LEVs, delineating restrictions on allowed roads, registration and licensing requirements, and the requirement of motorcycle or bicycle helmet.[20]

In 2024, LTO Administrative Order No. VDM-2024-044 revised these classification guidelines, allowing LEVs to operate on all public highways, excluding expressways, provided they are registered with the LTO and operated by appropriately licensed drivers. Certain classifications were also removed, and all two-wheeled vehicles were required to use motorcycle helmets.[21]

As of October 2024, provisions concerning the licensing, registration, and restrictions of LEVs in both LTO Administrative Order No. 2021-039 and LTO Administrative order No. VDM-2024-044 have been suspended following a directive from the Department of Transportation (DOTr) to review all LTO issuances that are inconsistent with the Electric Vehicle Industry Act (RA 11697).[19]

Roads
All public roads and highways, defined as thoroughfares, boulevards, driveways, avenues, parks, and alleys are covered by RA 4136. This does not include corridors within private property or any institutions.[1]

Republic Act No. 917 or the Philippine Highway Act of 1953 prohibits highways, bridges, or right-of-ways covered by RA 4136 from being obstructed, or from being usurped or converted to private use. The act also prohibits the removal or tampering of road infrastructure such as markers, signs, and other road-side facilities.[36]

RA 4136 also applies to limited-access highways, more commonly known as expressways, alongside additional traffic laws and restrictions provided by Republic Act No. 2000 and DPWC Administrative Order No. 1 series of 1968.

In Metro Manila, the Metro Manila Traffic Code covers all roads and public places within the metro.[22]

Parking
Under RA 4136 and the Metro Manila Traffic Code, a motor vehicle is considered to be parked when it has been stopped on the shoulder or edge of a highway for an "appreciable" period of time. A motor vehicle stopping to unload passengers or cargo is not considered to be parked if the vehicle moves away "without delay".[1][22]

RA 4136 states that parking a vehicle — by leaving it attended or unattended for an "appreciable" period of time — is prohibited inside an intersection or within 6 m (20 ft) of it, in front of a private driveway, on a pedestrian crossing, within 4 m (13 ft) of a fire hydrant or a driveway of a fire station, and where "no parking" signs are placed.[1]

Parking on any sidewalk, path, or alley not intended for vehicular traffic or parking (such as bicycle lanes) is also prohibited by RA 4136 and DOTr Department Order No. 2020-014.[1][18]

Standard rules
List of some standard rules of the road for motor vehicles and animal-drawn vehicles, all based on RA 4136:[1]

Keep to the right of the road except to pass others, where passing is allowed
Vehicles must not exceed their registered carrying capacity
Right of way at marked and unmarked intersections under various conditions
Prohibited places for parking a vehicle
Yield to police, fire department, and ambulance vehicles with a siren
Yield right of way to pedestrian crossings
Observe proper vehicle lighting and traffic light signalling
Observe caution while driving and avoid impeding traffic
Stopping if there has been a traffic collision
Speed limits
Main article: Speed limits in the Philippines
Speed limits for motor vehicles across the country are defined by RA 4136 based on the type of roads and their conditions. A higher maximum speed limit is generally applied to light motor vehicles while lower maximum speed limits are applied to heavier motor vehicles.[1]

There are no minimum speed limits on public roads except on expressways.[13] However, RA 4136 states that a driver of a motor vehicle must drive at a "careful and prudent speed, not greater nor less than is reasonable and proper" with regards to road conditions.[1]

Pursuant to DILG-DPWH-DOTr Joint Memorandum Circular 2018-001, local government units may designate lower maximum speed limits on local roads in the interest of road safety.[17][22]

Lane splitting and filtering
Main articles: Lane splitting and Lane sharing
Lane splitting and lane filtering is not explicitly illegal on Philippine roads for any type of vehicle. However, lane sharing (which is incorrectly defined as "lane splitting") is considered illegal for motorcycles under LTO Administrative Order 2008-015, which states that a motorcycle or scooter must observe one lane per vehicle only.[15] This policy however, is not actively enforced on the road.[37]

Section 3 of DPWC AO No. 1 s. 1968 prohibits any vehicle from lane splitting, lane sharing, or lane filtering on all expressways in the Philippines. This also applies to motorcycles, as of DPWH Department Order No. 123 s. 2001.[13][38]

Overtaking lanes and slow lanes
Main article: Overtaking
Expressways in the Philippines have a passing lane designated for overtaking and lanes designated for slow-moving vehicles.[13] This however does not apply to public roads by default.

Section 3 of DPWC AO No. 1 s. 1968 states that slow-moving vehicles on expressways must use the right lane and use the left lane only when passing.[13]

Traffic restrictions
Outside of the traffic code, there are traffic restrictions which designate the time and day that certain vehicles or road users are allowed to operate on, as well as specific roads where these restrictions are enforced or exempted on.

Public utility vehicles
Public transport vehicles, such as jeepneys, buses, and the UV Express are restricted to use designated lanes on certain roads. A notable example of this is the EDSA Busway, located on the inner lanes of EDSA in Metro Manila, which is restricted for the exclusive use of EDSA Carousel route buses and authorized government vehicles.

Similar to trucks, buses are to use the outermost lanes on the expressway. On the other hand, both public and private jeepneys are classified the same as cars and are allowed on all lanes.[citation needed]

Tricycles, pedicabs, and motorized tricycles used for public transport are prohibited from using national highways based on the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) Memorandum Circular No. 2020-036. This restriction does not apply to those being used for private use.[47]
