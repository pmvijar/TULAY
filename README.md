Towards Better Pedestrian Mobility 

TULAY
Jan 2025 - Present
TULAY is a data-driven GIS application focused on providing both insights and actions on certain areas based on its accessibility, safety, and mobility. It provides a systemic solution to centralize the efforts of different agencies and institutions for pedestrian well-being. With the use of artificial intelligence, it classifies and scores areas, utilizing public data, to determine locations that should be prioritized for improvements. TULAY then recommends relevant actions, such as providing infrastructure projects, to improve said areas. The objective is to make it easier to determine which aspect of an area needs to be addressed first and what should be prioritized. It also aims to help policy makers and/or government agencies, NGOs, engineers, and urban planners on urban planning. It intends to encourage and strengthen collaboration among different stakeholders in order to ease the improvement and development of our cities and improve data procurement. This should lead to better use of infrastructure budgets, focusing on the most impactful projects.

Our mission and vision is to encourage and strengthen collaboration among different stakeholders in order to ease the improvement and development of our cities and improve data procurement. This should lead to better use of infrastructure budgets, focusing on the most impactful projects.
