Approving the National Transport Policy
The National Transport Policy (NTP) has been officially approved by the NEDA Board, emphasizing its importance in guiding transport development.
This resolution signifies a commitment to enhancing the transport system across various sectors, including public and private transport.
NEDA BOARD RESOLUTION
The NTP aims to unify all transport system elements, ensuring that all stakeholders, including government agencies and private investors, adhere to its guidelines for development and management.
Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) are encouraged to leverage private sector expertise and resources, enhancing operational efficiency and risk management in transport projects.
All transport agencies and:
Public mass transportation is prioritized over private transport, with a focus on high-capacity systems in densely populated areas to improve accessibility.
Interconnectivity among different public transport modes is essential, promoting a seamless travel experience for users.
3.1:
Good governance in the transport sector is crucial for effective management and provision of transport infrastructure and services.
The resolution emphasizes the need for accountability and transparency in all transport-related activities.
3.3:
An optimal network of transport infrastructure, including highways and ports, must adhere to international safety and service quality standards.
The establishment of a passengers' bill of rights is proposed to enhance service quality and protect consumer interests.
4.32 - 4.35:
Definitions of key terms such as "Level of Service" and "Market failure" are provided to clarify the operational context of the transport policy.
These definitions help in understanding the challenges and standards that the transport sector must address.
8.1:
Local Government Units (LGUs) are tasked with preparing transport sector plans as part of their Comprehensive Development Plans to ensure alignment with national goals.
The government will allocate resources for local transport initiatives, focusing on improving intermodal transportation facilities.
8.2:
LGUs will provide input on funding criteria for local transport programs to ensure compliance with national regulations and policies.
This collaborative approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of local transport initiatives.
8.4:
LGUs are encouraged to support national government efforts in transport infrastructure projects by facilitating local consents and assisting in resettlement activities.
This support is vital for the timely implementation of transport projects.
8.5:
Fiscal mechanisms such as local tax exemptions may be utilized by LGUs to incentivize transport infrastructure development.
This approach aims to attract investment and improve local transport systems.
Section 9. Technical and Economic Criteria for Resource Allocation:
The allocation of government resources for transport projects will prioritize those that attract private financing and demonstrate economic viability.
Risk allocation in PPP contracts will follow established guidelines to ensure fair distribution among stakeholders.
Implementing agencies or:
The government aims to create a conducive environment for foreign investment in the transport sector by simplifying regulations and processes.
This initiative is expected to enhance competition and improve service delivery in public transport.
Section 12. Programs and Projects Assessment:
Transport agencies must ensure that proposed projects comply with international commitments and align with existing master plans.
Feasibility studies should consider the broader impacts on transport networks and regional development.
Section 14. Use of Data and Information Technology (IT) by Transport Agencies:
A centralized database for transport-related data will be established to facilitate planning and operational coordination among agencies.
Public transport operators are required to provide real-time operational data to enhance service efficiency and passenger information.
Section 22. Safety, Security, and Service Standards:
Regular updates to safety and service standards are mandated to align with international practices and ensure public safety.
The establishment of organic road safety units in transport agencies will enhance road safety measures and compliance.
Section 24. Defining a Hierarchy of Public Transportation in Urban Areas:
A structured hierarchy for urban public transport services will guide the assignment of transport modes based on land use and demand.
This approach aims to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of public transport systems in urban settings.
Section 25. Cost-Effective Mobility Management Measures:
Cost-effective measures will be prioritized to address traffic congestion, focusing on management strategies rather than infrastructure expansion.
Travel demand management techniques will be implemented to optimize the use of existing transport networks.
Section 28. Consolidation and Harmonization of Traffic Ordinances:
A unified ticketing system for traffic violations will be established to streamline enforcement and improve compliance.
This system aims to enhance the efficiency of traffic management across metropolitan areas.
Section 30. Truck Ban in Urban Roads:
Assistance will be provided to LGUs in formulating strategic plans for truck bans in urban areas to alleviate congestion.
This initiative is part of a broader strategy to improve urban transport efficiency.
Section 33. Establishment of Single Transport Document and Single Access Point One-Stop Shop:
A single transport document will facilitate multimodal freight transport, simplifying customs and regulatory processes.
The establishment of a one-stop shop for administrative procedures aims to reduce bureaucratic hurdles in transport logistics.
Section 35. Developing Interfaces between Long Distance Deliveries and Short Distance Distribution:
Efficient interfaces between long-distance and short-distance transport logistics will be developed to optimize urban distribution.
This approach considers land use and environmental impacts to enhance overall transport efficiency.
38.2 - 40.3:
Legislative actions will be pursued to create independent regulatory bodies for various transport sectors to enhance oversight and safety.
The establishment of a Philippine Railway Institute is proposed to develop skills and expertise in the rail sector, supporting capacity building and operational efficiency.
