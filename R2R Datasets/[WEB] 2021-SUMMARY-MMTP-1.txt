Title: Transportation Policy Potholes: Analyzing Metro Manila’s COVID-19 Response
Date: The article was published in 2021.

Summary:

The article examines the public transportation policies implemented by the Philippine government in Metro Manila during the COVID-19 pandemic. It highlights the critical role of public transportation in controlling the spread of the virus while ensuring that essential services remain accessible and that transport providers receive adequate support. The authors analyze these policies using a multi-dimensional framework that considers economic, social, environmental, and health aspects.

Key findings indicate that prior to the pandemic, the government was already working on improving the road-based public transportation system and addressing traffic congestion. However, the emergence of the pandemic shifted priorities, necessitating a focus on health and safety in public transport.

The article discusses several existing policies:

Health Protocols: The government implemented health protocols aligned with World Health Organization (WHO) standards to ensure passenger safety and minimize the risk of virus transmission in public transportation.

Support for Transport Providers: Financial assistance and resources were provided to public transport operators to help them maintain services during the pandemic. This included measures to support drivers and operators who faced significant losses due to reduced ridership.

Promotion of Non-Motorized Transport: The government encouraged alternative modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, to accommodate increased demand for transport while promoting environmentally friendly options.

Bayanihan to Recover as One Act: This legislation allocated approximately ₱1.3 billion for the development of infrastructure supporting active transport, including accessible sidewalks and protected bicycle lanes.

Build Build Build Program: The government continued its infrastructure projects aimed at job creation and improved connectivity, despite facing budget constraints due to the pandemic.

Modernization and Rationalization Plans: While these plans aimed to enhance the public transportation system, their forced implementation during the pandemic was criticized as being poorly timed and potentially detrimental to the industry. The authors argue that such measures could lead to increased operational costs for transport providers, reduced service availability for the public, and higher transportation and health costs for commuters.

The article concludes that while the government's policies are generally consistent with recommended practices for crisis management, the actual implementation has faced challenges. The authors advocate for a more balanced approach that prioritizes immediate health needs and economic recovery in the transportation sector, rather than pushing for modernization and rationalization during a time of crisis. They emphasize the importance of effective health protocols and support for transport providers to ensure the sustainability of public transportation services during the pandemic.
